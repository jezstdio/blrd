# BLRD! Your Online Real-time Social Voting Game.

Designed by [Roland Mészáros](https://rolandmeszaros.com) and developed by [Gábor Jez](https://jez.hu).

BLRD's is a Real-time voting game. You choose a topic, choose a site, and then just tap tap tap until your team win.

For real-time voting we use Redis with Websocket.
For the best experience, we previously used EJS template system, but changed it to React.js.

There original text was the following:
## What is this site?
Life isn't that black and white! Of course not, because it's BLUE and RED! Got it?

It's a fun, real-time, social voting game! We are not only interested in how much votes does a topic gets but, by allowing you to cast multiple votes, we can see how IMPORTANT a topic is for a certain group.

To be frank, we are just incredibly interested about the opinion of people, in many-many topics! It's time to DECIDE! Dark vs Milk Chocolate, Cats vs Dogs Ketchup or Mustard. It's anonimous and fun, so lets get started tell us whats important to you!
